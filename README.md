# Hulu-Tweet-Classification
The goal of my project was to provide a Hulu PM with an overview of valuable insights on Huluâ€™s marketplace performance as well as compare it to a major rival - Netflix.

Through extensive research and analysis, I created comparative benchmarks that would be leveraged to build a competitive intelligence dashboard 

Watson Assistant was used to train 120 manually classified tweets and test 30 new tweets to see if it could classify each tweet correctly
